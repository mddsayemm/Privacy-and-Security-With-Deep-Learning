# Phishing URL Detection Using Deep Learning
This project implements a feed forward neural network, a deep learning model with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for detecting  phishing URLs . The model is analyzed and trained with various URL's features, such as URL length and special characters, to detmine a  websites as phishing or legitimate. This project demonstrates the potential of deep learning in privacy and security for identifying phishing threats.
# Features
Deep Learning Architecture: The model is based on a fully connected feedforward neural network (MLP) with multiple layers, ReLU activation, and a sigmoid output for binary classification.
High Performance: Achieved high accuracy, precision, and recall during validation and testing phases.
# Dataset
This dataset consists of 247950 instances, of which 128541 are from phishing URLs and 119409 are from legitimate URLs.   It encompasses 41 features and 1 target variable (0=legitimate,1=phishing), making it suitable for implementing machine learning algorithms to identify phishing attacks.
