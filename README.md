# Phishing URL Detection Using Deep Learning
This project implements a feed forward neural network, a deep learning model with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) for detecting  phishing URLs . The model is analyzed and trained with various URL's features, such as URL length and special characters, to detmine a  websites as phishing or legitimate. This project demonstrates the potential of deep learning in privacy and security for identifying phishing threats.
# Features
1.Deep Learning Architecture: The model is based on a fully connected feedforward neural network (MLP) with multiple layers, ReLU activation, and a sigmoid output for binary classification.
2.High Performance: Achieved high accuracy, precision, and recall during validation and testing phases.
