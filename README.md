# Phishing URL Detection Using Deep Learning
This project implements a phishing URL detection system using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). The model analyzes various URL's features, such as URL length and special characters, to classify websites as phishing or legitimate. This project demonstrates the potential of deep learning in privacy and security for identifying phishing threats.
